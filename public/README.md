## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned that styling should be done "mobile first".
Styling was easier when the styles were done first for mobile then use media queries for desktop layouts.
